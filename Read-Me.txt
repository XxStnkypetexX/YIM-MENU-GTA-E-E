Hey, thanks for downloading from my discord server! (SCROLL DOWN FOR TUTORIAL)

Please note that you may need to disable your anti-virus on your computer.
This is not a virus, but sometimes anti-viruses will pick up false positives
and may also delete the .dll files or the injector as your computer might not recognise them and assume they're suspiciuous.

If you have any issues feel free to ask for help in our discord and we'll try out best to help out!

PLEASE DO NOT MOD ON YOUR MAIN ACCOUNT IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT BEING BANNED!

TUTORIAL:
Disable anti-virus
Place 'version_[unknowncheats.me]_.dll' inside of your GTAV Directory

Open Extreme_Inject_v3.exe
Drag YimMenuV2.dll into extreme injector
